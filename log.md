# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
**Today's Progress**: Learned some basics of JavaScript from [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** It is very hard for me to use semicolons as I have been coding in Python for a long time period. Also the idea of ``undefined`` behaviour of uninitialised variables is weird to me. But the thing I love that it have increment operator (``i++``,``i--``,etc..) which Python don't have.

**Link to some awesome J.S resources :** 

1. 30 seconds of code is a great place for find JavaScript code snippets which are great for both beginner and advanced coders. Link : https://30secondsofcode.org/index
2. Kallaway's codepen have a great projects to begin with as a beginner. Link : https://codepen.io/kallaway/
