# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Learned some basics of JavaScript from [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** It is very hard for me to use semicolons as I have been coding in Python for a long time period. Also the idea of ``undefined`` behaviour of uninitialised variables is weird to me. But the thing I love that it have increment operator (``i++``,``i--``,etc..) which Python don't have.

**Link to some awesome J.S resources :** 

1. 30 seconds of code is a great place for find JavaScript code snippets which are great for both beginner and advanced coders. Link : https://30secondsofcode.org/index
2. Kallaway's codepen have a great projects to begin with as a beginner. Link : https://codepen.io/kallaway/

### Day 1: January 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Still continuing the basic learning and also started [Automation using Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).

**Thoughts:** The freeCodeCamp course have a strong curriculum and takes more time than ordinary courses. Also the automation by python will be literally easier for me as I have some experience in it.

### Day 2: January 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learned functions in J.S and learning Regex expression in Python.

**Thoughts:** Didn't know that 90% of Internet is built on JavaScript!! BTW Regex expression is a great way to search elements. Also git push and git pull is more attractive in Hyper[My terminal] after using ``space-pull`` and ``gitrocket``, as they give rocket animations :)

### Day 3: January 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learning conditional logic and still continuing Regex.

**Thoughts:** Still thinking why Regex is not included in our KTU syllabus. Many beauties like Regex are often hidden .
